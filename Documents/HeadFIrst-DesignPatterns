# Head First in Design Patterns

## Design Principals
* Identify parts of the application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
* Program to an interface not an implementation.
* Composition over inheritance.

**The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets algorithm vay independently from clients that use it.**
