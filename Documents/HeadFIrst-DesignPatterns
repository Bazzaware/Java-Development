# Head First in Design Patterns

## Design Principles
* Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
* Program to an interface, not an implementation.


```Java
Public class MallardDuck extends Duck {
    public MallardDuck(){
        /*
        * Still using concrete classes for Quack
        */
        quackBehavior = new Quack();
        flyBehavior = new Quack();
    }

    public void display(){
        System.out println("I'm a real Mallard duck");
    }
}
```
